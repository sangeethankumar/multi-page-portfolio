During my Ph.D., I built pipelines to download, process, and analyze TESS data. I worked mainly in Python. I enjoyed this work, not just for my own research. I also helped other researchers with their code. I found it very satisfying to help others with their work.

In my current role, I work with researchers on their programming needs. This also helps me prepare for a future in industry.
